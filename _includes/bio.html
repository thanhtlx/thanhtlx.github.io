<h2>Short Bio</h2>
<p>
    I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Technology at the
    <a href="https://uet.vnu.edu.vn/">VNU University of Engineering and Technology (UET)</a>,
    with an expected graduation date of <strong>June 2026</strong>. I am actively seeking opportunities
    to continue my academic journey through a <strong>PhD program in Computer Science</strong>, where I aim
    to conduct impactful research in <strong>AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    My primary research focuses on improving the <strong>reliability</strong>, <strong>quality</strong>, and
    <strong>interpretability</strong> of code generated or processed by Large Language Models (LLMs).
    I am particularly interested in developing <strong>deep-learning–based techniques</strong> for
    automated code quality assessment, correctness evaluation, and trustworthy AI-assisted software development.
</p>
<p>
    I have also gained research experience at the
    iSE Lab at UET, where I strengthened my skills in
    <strong>software analysis</strong>, <strong>AI model evaluation</strong>, and
    <strong>code-centric deep learning</strong>.
